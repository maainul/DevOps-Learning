   -v $(pwd)/custom_config:/usr/share/jenkins/ref \
   jenkins/jenkins:lts
   ```
   - Any custom files (like plugins or configurations) in the `/custom_config` folder will be copied during the container's first run.

2. **Pre-Install Plugins**:  
   - Create a `plugins.txt` file with the required plugins:  
     ```txt
     git
     workflow-aggregator
     docker-workflow
     blueocean
     ```
   - Use this Dockerfile to build a Jenkins image with the plugins:  
     ```dockerfile
     FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
     COPY plugins.txt /usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins.txt
     RUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins < /usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins.txt
     ```
   - Build and run the container:  
     ```bash
     docker build -t custom-jenkins .
     docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins custom-jenkins
     ```

---
